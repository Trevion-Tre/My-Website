                Track Side, founded by Trevion Butts in July 2024, aims to revolutionize the racing industry by facilitating the creation and funding of race tracks, particularly in underprivileged communities. The company connects race tracks with essential businesses to provide services like mechanics and educational classes on safe driving and racing techniques. Targeting cities such as Atlanta and Los Angeles, Track Side supports current and aspiring race track owners who struggle with funding, while also addressing street racing issues through safe, regulated environments and educational programs. By prioritizing community support and inclusivity, Track Side fosters responsible car culture and aims to generate $250,000 in revenue by year 5 through innovative services and strategic partnerships.</p>
